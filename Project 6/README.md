## Project Description – Societal & Individual Impacts of Information Systems

### What We Were Asked to Do
This assignment required selecting a specific information system and explaining its impact on individuals and/or society. The task involved defining the information system, explaining how it works, analyzing its impacts using theory and real-world examples, and discussing the broader implications for people and society. The presentation was required to be educational, focused, and supported by research evidence.

### What I Did
For this project, I focused on social media notification systems and examined how they affect user concentration at both individual and societal levels. I defined notification systems as persuasive information systems that use algorithms and behavioral data to deliver alerts such as likes, messages, and reminders across platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, and Snapchat.

I explained how these systems work by analyzing how algorithms determine notification timing and type to capture user attention and increase engagement. Using research studies and course material, I demonstrated how notifications interrupt cognitive flow, increase cognitive load, and encourage habitual checking behavior.

I supported the analysis with real-world examples, including Instagram’s like batching, WhatsApp’s “seen” feature, and Snapchat/TikTok streaks, showing how design choices influence user behavior even when the app is not actively opened. I also discussed individual impacts such as reduced academic performance, increased stress, and difficulty maintaining focus, as well as societal impacts including shorter attention spans, workplace inefficiency, and more distracted learning environments.

### Conclusion
The project highlighted that notification systems are powerful information systems with significant influence on human attention and behavior. Understanding how these systems operate helps individuals and society recognize their effects and regain control over digital attention.
